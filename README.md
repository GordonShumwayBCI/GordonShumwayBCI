<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Brain Computing Interface (BCI) technologies are becomning more common and bring with them a new set of security risks, concerns, and vulnerabilities. This project aims to provide a security framework for testing, policies, legislating and securing BCI technologies.


Here's what you will find here:
* BCI security policy templates
* BCI security run book templates
* BCI security framework templates
* BCI resources and legislation templates

It is the hope of this project to provide resources and a security framework to help reduce the risks and concerns surrounding the implementation of Brain Computing Interfaces (BCI).
